This repository provides the code for dataloader and evaluation code for Env-QA dataset.

## Requirements
To install requirements, run:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Dataloader
Please download all annotations (`train_full_question.json`, `val_full_question.json`, `test_full_question.json`, `env_qa_video_annotations_v1.json`, `env_qa_full_predicted_segment.json`, `dictionaries.pkl`, `dict_object_name.json`, `all_instructions.json`) and features (`env_qa_objects.h5`, `env_qa_frame_obj_cls.h5`), and put them under the `data/` folder.
Please see the webpage (https://envqa.github.io/) to download the dataset.

We provide a start code on `dataloader_evaluater.ipynb`

You can follow the guidance to organize these files to load the dataset.

## Evaluation
We also provide an example in `dataloader_evaluater.ipynb`. Please see the file to use our evaluation code.
